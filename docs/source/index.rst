Welcome to yace
===============

**yace** is a foreign-function-interface (FFI) compiler designed to ease the
development and maintenance of C APIs, their libraries and the
FFI-bindings/wrappers using them.

* The project is hosted on `GitHUB`_

* Documentation is available at `safl.dk/yace`_

**yace** is a new project, with a bunch of things it want to get done, why?
Because there are some projects that need a better way to handle C headers and
libraries bindings. If you want to help out, then don't be shy, there are
plenty of things to do.
