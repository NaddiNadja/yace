 Emitter Targets (``yet``)
===========================

The **yace** Emitter Targets (``yet``/``yets``) are encapsulations of the
various components needed in **yace** to add support for code emission target.

This part of **yace** is not yet implemented. However, the idea is to:

* Ensure that ``yets`` are pluggable
  - Produce a cookie-cutter template to create the boiler-plate for a new **yet**
  - Distribute **yets** via PyPI e.g. ``yace-yet-zig``

For now, this part of **yace** is tied into a single instance of the
code-emitter. However, this pat of the docs are provided to briefly describe
the roadmap and intent of **yace**.
