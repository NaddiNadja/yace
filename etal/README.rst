Et Al
=====

The scripts, tools, and files found here are auxiliary to the project itself.
The directory is named to suggest the meaning "et'al" / "and others".

Alternative directory names would be: aux, scripts, and toolbox. However, aux
is reserved on some filesystems, and the other two often collides with entities
that are actually part of the project. Thus, the using the name: etal.

Some **etal** staples include:

* bump.py
* mkhelp.py
* pkgs/{.sh,.bat}
